<h1>About MVVM Architecture</h1>
<p>
MVVM is one of the architectural patterns which enhances separation of concerns, it allows separating the user interface logic from the business (or the back-end) logic. Its target (with other MVC patterns goal) is to achieve the following principle ‚ÄúKeeping UI code simple and free of app logic in order to make it easier to manage‚Äù.
    
MVVM is an abbreviation of Model View Veiw model where your presentaion layer will be divided into three packages -
    
<Br/> <b>Model</b> : Model represents the data and business logic of the app.
    
<Br/> <b>View</b> : The view role in this pattern is to observe (or subscribe to) a ViewModel observable to get data in order to update UI elements accordingly.
    
<Br/> <b>View Model</b> : ViewModel interacts with model and also prepares observable(s) that can be observed by a View.
